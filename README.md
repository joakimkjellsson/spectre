S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Spectral Energy Tendencies and Integrals in the Ocean &amp; Atmosphere)

A set of Python/Cython functions and scripts to calculate the transfer of kinetic/potential energy 
in the atmosphere and ocean. 
The code was used by Kjellsson & Zanna (Fluids, 2017) http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fluids2030045
to calculate kinetic energy spectra and tendencies from a set of global ocean simulations with NEMO.
